![UML Diagram](doc/uml.png)

1. In our UML diagram, should Task be a class or should it simply be a string?  Why or why not?
   It should become a class, but at the moment does not need to be. With more enhancements having it be a class would be better.
   
1. What future enhancements might you add to this project next?  Does the answer to this question change your answer to the first question?
   Add some form of saved or lost time.
