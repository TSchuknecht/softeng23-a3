![UML Diagram](doc/uml.png)

1. In our UML diagram, should Task be a class or should it simply be a string?  Why or why not?

   We believe having a Task Class would be more 'future proof'. Classes could store variables and methods for future enhancements that would shorten the complexity of our code, ie; make it more readable.
   
1. What future enhancements might you add to this project next?  Does the answer to this question change your answer to the first question?

   Add some form of saved or lost time. For instance, if we made it possible for a user to specify how long they think a task will take them, and then compare it with how much time they end up actually take.
